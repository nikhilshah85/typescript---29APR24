Industry coined a term - Web Revolution - 2008-2009 


-----
	every developer today needs to understand Web Revolution 

	1. Average user has started using internet in 2005
	2. During those days they used internet for 	
		surfing, email, booking, project, games, chats
	3. They used internet mostly at Home, Cyber Cafe, office
	4. Connection was : LAN, Broadband, dial up 
	5. Device : Desktop, laptop 
	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
		however around 2009-2010 : world had changed tremendously

	1.People using internet in 2010 and onwards are different 
	   everyone uses internet
	2. People use internet for : Everything
	3. People use internet at : Everywhere 
	4. Connection : Wifi + 5G+ everywhere
	5. Devise : Desktop, laptop, Mobile, Ipad, tables, Watch, refrigerator,
			Car, washing machine, TV 

		This is all web app
	6. Habits :  When u at vacation, they want to check in - use location
		     Photos, zoom in zoom out
		     Videos, flip the phone (users expect the app also will respond)
		     History and cache - to speed up the devise
	7. Cross platform - Android, IOS, Blackberry ,Symbian
		send whats app to anyone 
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Thus as a developer you need to make sure you are able to cop-up with above requirement (responsiveness)

	all of this is on client devise - on clients 1 hand (thumb)

		all of this is on client devise - which can be managed using client side scripting
		There is only 1 language for this - JavaScript (Web Standard, W3C)

		But JavaScript had major, major, major flaws, drawback, missing features
			which was not possible to use

			1. JS did not had data types
			2. it was not Object Oriented (major feature for development)
			3. Not compiled, no error checking, no debugging, etc...

		Thus a new improved JavaScript was needed 
		ECMA - European Computer Manufacturing Association (from European countries)
			They added above features and more to JavaScript - fantastic (2008-2009) - ES6
			This was the most difficult thing to use for programmer

		Thus Andres Heilberg - simplified it - by writing compilers and new language over it
