1.You write you code in a file - and save the file as with .ts extention
		eg. demo1.ts

	we use Typescript language in the file 
	(create classes, methods, functions, constructors, Enum, etc....)

	File is executed on web browsers - but then do not understand Typescript


2. Thus, we need to convert this file into JavaScript (useing tsc typescript    compiler)
	This will convert .ts file in a separate .js file

3. and then execute the file
	javascript file can executed on browser with a webpage, or nodejs
