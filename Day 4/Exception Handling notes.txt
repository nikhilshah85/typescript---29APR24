			Exception Handling

	--This is to handle the errors at runtime
	--End users are not technical people, they tend to interact with application
		in a non-technical way (Human way)
	--If errors will happen at runtime, application will crash
		which can result in 
			Loss of data, which can create a disaster
			May not see the user again
---------------------------------------------------------------------
		Thus we use Exception Handling
	1. This is a 2 part process
		a. in a class, we use Throw New Exception('Error message');

		b. in the execution, where user interaction will be there
		this is done useing a standard block across industry and frameworks(.net,java,python..)
			try..catch..finally
				finally is optional
