		Interface : (also called as contract)

		Always is between 2 parties


	At the enterprise application level, there are different teams 
	which works on different modules

	they use the same class for extending the functionality
		eg. Loan related development will be processed by 1 team
		    Transaction managed by different team
		    Investment management 
		    Insurance

		all this teams will create their own classes
		they may not even know each other
		
	but we need to make sure they follow the guidance provided by us
	and it is a mandate
		we have quality check tools which will catch this mandate

----------------------------------
	so we will give them the contract (paper based outside the software)
	we give Interface inside the software (if you do not follow this app will not compile)
	


	----------------
	we create only declaration of properties, methods in an interface
		definition will be done by class creator

	we will create an interface which will have properties and 
		method declatation


	inheritance
	interface
		are both different
		inheritance is from a class - class has method definition and declaration
		interface is from a Interface - interface has only declaration

		classes are inherited     - using extends keyword
			class Savings extends Accounts
			{
			}
		interface are implemented - using implements keyword
			class Current implements IAccount
			{
			}


		class is a BluePrint
		interface is a Contract
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			create a interface for IVehicle
				every vehicle needs below structure
			1. no of seats
			2. no of doors
			3. color
			4. company

			methods
			start
			stop

		have 2 classes, Car and Truck
