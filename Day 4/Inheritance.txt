Inheritance : this is reuse the code already written
		

	BankingSystem
		has different types of accounts, 			
			Savings
			Current
			PF

			Loan (this is managed by different teams)

	all the accounts will have lots of funcaniality in common like
		accNo, accName, accType, accBalance,withdraw,deposit,transfer etc..
		we should not write all this code 4 times !!

		instead, we can use inheritance, which will be written in a common class 
		and other classes will reuse it (extend it / inherit it)
