1. if we have to inherit all the properties and methods/function from another class
	Accounts class - has lots of properties and methods

and

	savings class needs to inherit 

	how can we do it


	class Savings extends Accounts
	{

	}

	how to inherit a class 
---------------------------
	similarly how do we put an interface on to a class
		class Savings __________ IAccounts
		{

		}
----------------------------------------

		Exception Handling

	1. in the class methods we use throw new Error('');
		when ever you feel user will do a mistake due to which my application can 			crash
	2. when trying to use the method, you use
		try
		{

		}
		catch(error)
		{

		}
		finally
		{
			//this is neutral which will always execute in the end					console.log('Thank you for banking');
		}

----------------------
 	We have created classes and properies, for data we have hard coded the data
